## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/kailas-rathod/react-native-otp-auto-verify/issues). For sensitive reports you may contact the maintainer directly. We aim to acknowledge within 48 hours and will provide updates as we assess and address the issue.

## Supply Chain

- **Lockfile**: Use `yarn install --immutable` so builds use only resolved versions from `yarn.lock`.
- **Updates**: Dependabot opens PRs for dependency updates; review and merge as needed.
